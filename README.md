# Norman S. Nise Cyber Exploration Labs - MATLAB Live Scripts
This repository contains the MATLAB Live Script versions of the Lab Exercises contained in the Cyber Exploration Lab Supplement provided by Noman S. Nise for his textbook "Control Systems Engineering". These exercises *DO NOT* add any new material to the labs nor do they omit any content. There have been very minor wording changes to help accommodate the Live Script format (e.g. adding (produced below) when referencing a Figure). We do not claim the original Lab Exercises as our own work, and would implore you to explore the resources made for this textbook on your own.
